# Code Quality Checklist
**Profolio Enterprise-Grade Development Standards**

**Version**: 3.0  
**Last Updated**: June 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Enhanced for Production, Security & Performance

---

## üìã **Overview**

This checklist ensures all code changes maintain our enterprise-grade standards for security, performance, and maintainability. Use this document for **every file change, addition, or modification** to maintain consistency across the codebase.

**üö® CRITICAL**: Special attention required for AI-generated code to prevent security vulnerabilities and deployment issues.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **NEVER BUILD THESE YOURSELF** *(CRITICAL SECURITY PRINCIPLE)*

### üö® **Authentication Systems** *(USE EXISTING SOLUTIONS ONLY)*
- [ ] **NEVER build custom authentication** - Use proven solutions like Auth0, Supabase Auth, NextAuth.js, or Clerk
- [ ] **NEVER build custom password hashing** - Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 libraries only
- [ ] **NEVER build custom session management** - Use established session stores and libraries
- [ ] **NEVER build custom JWT handling** - Use well-maintained JWT libraries with proper validation
- [ ] **NEVER build custom OAuth flows** - Use official OAuth libraries and providers

**Why**: Authentication is extremely complex with countless edge cases. Even security experts get it wrong. Use battle-tested solutions.

### üîê **Encryption & Cryptography** *(USE EXISTING SOLUTIONS ONLY)*
- [ ] **NEVER build custom encryption algorithms** - Use AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305 via crypto libraries
- [ ] **NEVER build custom key derivation** - Use PBKDF2, scrypt, or Argon2 via established libraries
- [ ] **NEVER build custom random number generation** - Use crypto.randomBytes() or equivalent secure sources
- [ ] **NEVER build custom certificate handling** - Use TLS libraries and certificate authorities
- [ ] **NEVER build custom hashing functions** - Use SHA-256, SHA-3, or Blake2 via crypto libraries

**Why**: Cryptography is mathematically complex with subtle implementation details. Mistakes lead to complete security failures.

### üîë **Always Use These Instead**
- **Node.js**: Use built-in `crypto` module for all cryptographic operations
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js, Auth0, Supabase Auth, Firebase Auth, Clerk
- **Encryption**: Use `crypto.createCipherGCM()`, never `crypto.createCipher()`
- **Hashing**: Use `bcrypt`, `scrypt`, or `argon2` libraries for passwords
- **Random**: Use `crypto.randomBytes()`, never `Math.random()` for security
