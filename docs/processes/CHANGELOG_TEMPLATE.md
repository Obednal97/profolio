# Changelog Entry Template

**üö® CRITICAL: GET CURRENT DATE FIRST**

```bash
# ALWAYS run this before creating changelog entry
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
echo "Today's date for changelog: $CURRENT_DATE"

# Check last release date to ensure chronological order
echo "Last release was:"
grep -m1 "##.*v[0-9]" CHANGELOG.md
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è NEW DATE MUST BE AFTER THE ABOVE DATE"
```

Use this template for all changelog entries. **Only include sections that are relevant to the specific release** - omit sections with no content.

## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
**‚ö†Ô∏è Replace YYYY-MM-DD with actual current date from command above**

## Template Usage Guidelines

### Section Rules
1. **Always include version and date** in the header
2. **Only include sections with content** - omit empty sections entirely
3. **Use consistent emoji prefixes** for each section type
4. **Keep descriptions concise** - focus on user impact, not technical details
5. **Group related items** under appropriate subsections

### Writing Style
- **Use action verbs**: "Added", "Fixed", "Improved", "Enhanced"
- **Focus on user benefit**: What does this change mean for users?
- **Be specific but brief**: Mention the key change without excessive detail
- **Use consistent formatting**: Follow the bullet point structure
