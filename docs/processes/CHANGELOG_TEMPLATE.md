# Changelog Entry Template

**🚨 CRITICAL: GET CURRENT DATE FIRST**

```bash
# ALWAYS run this before creating changelog entry
CURRENT_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
echo "Today's date for changelog: $CURRENT_DATE"

# Check last release date to ensure chronological order
echo "Last release was:"
grep -m1 "##.*v[0-9]" CHANGELOG.md
echo "⚠️ NEW DATE MUST BE AFTER THE ABOVE DATE"
```

Use this template for all changelog entries. **Only include sections that are relevant to the specific release** - omit sections with no content.

## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
**⚠️ Replace YYYY-MM-DD with actual current date from command above**
