### **Launcher Script File Detection**

- **Impact**: "bash: line 19: /opt/profolio/scripts/installers/install-or-update.sh: No such file or directory"

- **Resolution**: Added intelligent local file existence checks before execution
- **Result**: Universal installation compatibility across all system states

### **Missing Directory Structure Support**

- **Issue**: Older installations lack the updated scripts/installers/ directory structure
- **Impact**: Installation failures on legitimate production servers
- **Root Cause**: Launcher assumed local installer files were always present
- **Resolution**: Added automatic fallback to download latest installer from repository
- **Result**: Seamless updates from any Profolio version

## üîß **Technical Improvements**

- **Smart Launcher Architecture**: Enhanced install.sh with modular functions for standard and Proxmox installation paths
- **File System Intelligence**: Robust local file detection before attempting script execution
- **Remote Fallback System**: Seamless download and execution of latest installer when local files are missing
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminates bash execution errors for missing local script files
- **Universal Compatibility**: Single launcher works across all installation states and versions

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Compatibility**
