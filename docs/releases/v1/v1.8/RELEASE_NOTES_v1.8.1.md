## ‚ú® **New Features**

### üéØ **Customizable Optimization Levels**
- **Safe Optimization**: Removes only actual devDependencies, preserves all production packages (~600-800MB final size)
- **Aggressive Optimization**: Safe optimization plus Docker-style cleanup including source maps, debug files, documentation (~400-500MB final size)
- **Smart Default Selection**: Quick install mode uses safe optimization automatically, advanced mode provides choice
- **Comprehensive Warnings**: Clear explanations of trade-offs and risks for each optimization level

### üìä **Comprehensive Installer Statistics**
- **Beautiful Summary Table**: Runtime tracking, service downtime monitoring, file counts, and disk usage metrics
- **Real-Time Progress**: Transparent operation timing and resource usage throughout installation/updates
- **Download Size Tracking**: Accurate reporting of actual download sizes vs misleading total app size
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed statistics for monitoring and optimization insights

### üîÑ **Installer Self-Update System**
- **Automatic Updates**: Installer updates itself as part of every update/repair process
- **Backup Protection**: Creates backup of current installer before updating with syntax validation
- **Latest Features**: Ensures users always have the most recent installer capabilities and bug fixes
- **Safe Validation**: Downloaded script syntax checking before replacement to prevent corruption

### ‚ö° **Incremental Update System**
- **Sparse Checkout**: Revolutionary bandwidth savings by downloading only changed files during updates
- **Shallow Cloning**: Git fetch optimizations reduce download sizes from 1.6GB to mere kilobytes
- **Smart Git Operations**: Enhanced git strategies for minimal bandwidth usage and faster updates
- **Progress Transparency**: Clear visibility into actual download progress and bandwidth savings

---

## üêõ **Bug Fixes**

- **FIXED: Production Optimization Reliability** - Precise devDependency removal from package.json instead of broad wildcards, preserves all production dependencies (dotenv, next, @types/decimal.js, etc.)
- **FIXED: Service Startup Issues** - Corrected backend start script to use compiled `dist/main.js` instead of CLI tools, eliminates service failure after optimization
- **FIXED: Installer Statistics Display** - Shows actual download sizes (3.47 KiB for incremental updates) instead of misleading total app size (1.6GB)
- **FIXED: Duplicate Configuration Checks** - Eliminated redundant install mode sections and streamlined optimization flow for cleaner code structure

---

## üîß **Improvements**

### Technical
- **Smart Dependency Management**: Reads devDependencies directly from package.json for precise removal, never affects production packages
- **Enhanced Production Safety**: Comprehensive validation and rollback protection with automatic backup systems
- **Git Operation Optimization**: Intelligent sparse checkout and shallow cloning for massive bandwidth reduction
- **Border Alignment System**: Perfect table formatting with intelligent padding system for statistics display

### UI/UX
- **Quick Install Mode**: Safe optimization by default with no prompts, perfect for typical users who want simplicity
- **Advanced Mode Options**: Power users retain full control with optimization choice and comprehensive trade-off warnings
- **Transparent Statistics**: Real-time visibility into operation timing, service downtime, file counts, and resource usage
- **Clear Optimization Warnings**: Detailed explanations of risks, benefits, and expected outcomes for each optimization level

### Performance
- **Space Reduction**: Safe mode achieves ~600-800MB final size, aggressive mode reaches ~400-500MB with informed trade-offs
- **Download Efficiency**: Incremental updates download only changed files (typical: 3.47 KiB) instead of entire repository
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring of file counts, disk usage, operation timing, and resource consumption
- **Memory Optimization**: Enhanced resource management during optimization processes with proper cleanup patterns

## üì¶ **Installation & Updates**

### üöÄ **Standard Update**
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Obednal97/profolio/main/install-or-update.sh)"
```

### üîÑ **Migration Notes**
Fully backward compatible - no manual steps required. Existing installations will automatically benefit from:
- Enhanced optimization options during next update
- Improved installer self-update capability
- Better statistics tracking and transparency
- More reliable production dependency management

### üîç **Verification**
```bash
# Verify successful update and check app size
du -sh /opt/profolio
systemctl status profolio-backend profolio-frontend
```
