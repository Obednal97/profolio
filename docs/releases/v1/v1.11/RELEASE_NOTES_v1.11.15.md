## 🛠️ Installation & Updates

### **New Installation Features**

**Automatic Configuration Creation**

- Installer now creates firebase-config.json automatically for self-hosted deployments
- Proper environment variable configuration with production defaults
- Enhanced file permissions and ownership management
- Streamlined configuration process with fewer manual steps

### **Existing Installation Upgrade**

For installations experiencing production environment errors:

```bash
# Navigate to installation directory
cd /opt/profolio

# Pull latest fixes
sudo -u profolio git pull origin main

# Create missing firebase-config.json
sudo tee frontend/public/firebase-config.json > /dev/null <<EOF
{
  "apiKey": "",
  "authDomain": "",
  "projectId": "",
  "storageBucket": "",
  "messagingSenderId": "",
  "appId": "",
  "disabled": true,
  "note": "Placeholder config for self-hosted installations"
}
EOF

# Ensure proper environment variable
echo 'NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_MODE=local' | sudo tee -a frontend/.env.production

# Rebuild with new configurations
cd frontend
sudo -u profolio pnpm run build

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart profolio-frontend profolio-backend
```

**Verification Steps:**

1. Check browser console for "Auth mode: local" message
2. Verify no 404 errors for firebase-config.json
3. Confirm no MIME type blocking errors
4. Test authentication functionality
