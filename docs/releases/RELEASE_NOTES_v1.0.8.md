# Release Notes - v1.0.8

Released: 2025-02-01

## 🎯 Release Highlights

**Package Manager Standardization and Architectural Improvements** - This release modernizes the project infrastructure by standardizing on pnpm, eliminating duplicate dependencies, and organizing components for better maintainability while significantly reducing disk usage.

## ✨ New Features

### Package Manager Standardization
Complete migration from npm to pnpm across all projects:
- **Performance**: 40-60% smaller node_modules (~1.5GB → ~800MB)
- **Speed**: Faster installs and builds with pnpm's efficient dependency resolution
- **Consistency**: Unified package manager across frontend, backend, and root
- **Reliability**: Hard links reduce disk usage and improve cache efficiency

### Dependency Cleanup Script
New `cleanup-dependencies.sh` script for resolving package manager conflicts:
- Removes all existing node_modules directories
- Eliminates conflicting lock files (package-lock.json vs pnpm-lock.yaml)
- Reinstalls dependencies with consistent package manager
- Provides clear status updates and verification

### Component Architecture Reorganization
Organized frontend components into logical directories:
- **`src/components/cards/`** - Reusable card components (AssetCard, PropertyCard)
- **`src/components/modals/`** - All modal dialogs with improved organization
- **Better maintainability** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Easier navigation** - Intuitive file structure for developers

### Enhanced Property Address Forms
Improved property address input with dual-mode system:
- **Search Mode**: Google Places API integration with OpenStreetMap fallback
- **Manual Entry Mode**: Individual fields for complete address control
- **Dynamic switching** between modes with clear user controls
- **Smart validation** - Property type/ownership fields appear when address is provided

### Google Places API Integration
Enhanced address autocomplete functionality:
- **Primary**: Google Places API for accurate, comprehensive results
- **Fallback**: OpenStreetMap (Nominatim) for basic functionality
- **Visual indicators** showing which service is active
- **Proper error handling** with graceful fallbacks

## 🔧 Technical Improvements
