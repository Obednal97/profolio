2. **Use browser back** - Safe to go back and forth between settings
3. **Mobile not recommended** - Use desktop browser for setup
4. **Save frequently** - Don't lose work by navigating away
5. **Test as you go** - Create a test issue to verify templates work

**Remember:** The GitHub interface updates regularly, so some details might look slightly different, but the core functionality and navigation remains the same!
