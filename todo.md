## üìÅ Organization Structure

This project uses a three-tier organization system:

1. **[PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md)** - Major features requiring planning and specification
2. **[TASKS.md](TASKS.md)** - Simple tasks completable in <4 hours
3. **Project Specs** - Detailed technical specifications in `docs/projects/`

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### Starting a Project

1. Choose a project from [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md)
2. Create specification in `docs/projects/[PROJECT_NAME]_SPEC.md`
3. Get specification reviewed and approved
4. Implement following the specification
5. Update project status in PROJECTS.md

### Completing a Task

1. Choose a task from [TASKS.md](TASKS.md)
2. Verify it's truly a simple task (<4 hours)
3. Complete implementation
4. Test thoroughly
5. Mark as complete in TASKS.md

### Creating a Specification

Use the template in [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md#next-steps) which includes:

- Executive Summary
- Current State Analysis
- Proposed Solution
- Technical Architecture
- Implementation Plan
- Success Metrics

## üìÖ Suggested Timeline

### (Revenue & Growth)

- Complete Stripe Integration (3 weeks)
- Admin Dashboard (2 weeks)
- Email System (2 weeks)

### (Platform & Polish)

- NextAuth Migration (4 weeks)
- Reports System (3 weeks)
- Mobile Performance (2 weeks)

## üèÜ Success Criteria

A project/task is considered complete when:

- ‚úÖ All functionality works as specified
- ‚úÖ Tests are written and passing
- ‚úÖ Documentation is updated
- ‚úÖ Code review is complete
- ‚úÖ No performance regression
- ‚úÖ Security review passed (if applicable)

## üìù Quick Links

- **Projects**: [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md)
- **Tasks**: [TASKS.md](TASKS.md)
- **Specifications**: `docs/projects/`
- **Architecture Docs**: `docs/architecture/`
- **Testing Guide**: `docs/testing/`

## üí° Notes

- **Projects vs Tasks**: If it takes >4 hours or involves multiple systems, it's a project
- **Specifications First**: All projects need specs before implementation
- **Security Priority**: Security projects should be completed first
- **Quality over Speed**: Better to do fewer things well than many things poorly
