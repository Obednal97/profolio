## 🚀 How to Contribute

### Starting a Project

1. Choose a project from [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md)
2. Create specification in `docs/projects/[PROJECT_NAME]_SPEC.md`
3. Get specification reviewed and approved
4. Implement following the specification
5. Update project status in PROJECTS.md

### Completing a Task

1. Choose a task from [TASKS.md](TASKS.md)
2. Verify it's truly a simple task (<4 hours)
3. Complete implementation
4. Test thoroughly
5. Mark as complete in TASKS.md

### Creating a Specification

Use the template in [PROJECTS.md](PROJECTS.md#next-steps) which includes:

- Executive Summary
- Current State Analysis
- Proposed Solution
- Technical Architecture
- Implementation Plan
- Success Metrics

## 💡 Notes

- **Projects vs Tasks**: If it takes >4 hours or involves multiple systems, it's a project
- **Specifications First**: All projects need specs before implementation
- **Security Priority**: Security projects should be completed first
- **Quality over Speed**: Better to do fewer things well than many things poorly
