# Demo Mode Setup for Trading 212 Integration

## ‚úÖ Demo Mode Now Enabled

The Trading 212 integration now supports demo mode, allowing you to test with your real API key without requiring authentication.

## üîß How It Works

### Automatic Demo User Fallback
All API endpoints now automatically fall back to a demo user when:
- No authorization header is provided
- Authorization header contains `demo-token` or `dev-token-123`
- JWT token verification fails

### Demo User Details
```javascript
const DEMO_USER = {
  userId: 'demo-user-id',
  email: 'demo@example.com'
};
```

1. Navigate to `/app/assetManager`
2. Click the "API Config" button
3. The modal will open without requiring authentication

### Step 2: Enter Your Trading 212 API Key
1. In the "Trading 212 API Key" field, enter your real API key

## üîß Troubleshooting

### No Data Synced
- Verify you have positions in your Trading 212 account
