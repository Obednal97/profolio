# Profolio Projects Overview

_Last updated: September 2025_

## üéØ Project Management Approach

Each project should have:

1. **Project Specification** - Detailed technical design document
2. **Implementation Plan** - Step-by-step development roadmap
3. **Testing Strategy** - How we'll validate the implementation
4. **Success Metrics** - How we'll measure completion
5. **Risk Assessment** - Potential issues and mitigation
