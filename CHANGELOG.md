# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v2.0.0] - 09-08-2026

### One application

The separate NestJS backend is gone. Profolio is now a single Next.js
application: one deployable, one authentication path, one set of types. Around
14,000 lines of NestJS were removed and replaced with 53 route handlers over
domain services in `src/server/modules/`.

**This is a breaking change for self-hosted installs.** There is no longer a
second service on port 3001. `docker-compose.yml` starts one application
container plus Postgres and Redis, and migrations are applied by the entrypoint
on startup.

### Why

The two-service split was the direct cause of a class of defect rather than an
incidental cost: 18 of the 45 route files existed only to forward a request to
the other service, and three separate JWT verifications had grown up across the
boundary, two of them broken.

### Fixed

Every one of these was live before this release.

#### Money and market data

- **Price sync repriced every holding to a hundredth of its unit price.** It
  wrote a unit price in dollars into a column holding a position total in
  cents, and ignored quantity entirely. A $313.33 share became $3.13.
- Price sync never recorded price history, so the portfolio chart had nothing
  to draw even while prices were being fetched.
- The scheduled sync never ran at all on serverless: it waited on a flag set by
  a 30-second timer that a cold start never reaches.
- Symbol search returned prices a hundred times too large.
- Property money used a truthiness test, so a legitimate zero became "not
  provided" - no mortgage, no HOA and no rental income could not be recorded.

#### Fabricated data removed

- The performance chart was drawing a sine wave plus `Math.random()` around a
  hardcoded $10,000 and presenting it as the user's own history.
- The asset manager invented a flat chart line in two more places.
- A failed price lookup answered `0`, which the asset form multiplied by
  quantity and displayed as a valuation.

#### Security

- An API-key encryption secret fell back to a default string published in this
  repository, so a deployment missing the variable encrypted every user's
  provider keys under a publicly known key and reported success.
- A symbol-search endpoint resolved any failed authentication to a demo
  identity and verified tokens with a hardcoded fallback secret.
- Admin user creation had no validation and stored passwords in plain text;
  admin listings returned password hashes to the browser.
- Two market-data endpoints documented as admin-only had no role check.
- Three components verified JWTs themselves; all now use one session resolver.

#### Things that did not work

- `/api/assets/{id}` had no handler, so editing and deleting an asset returned
  a 404 page.
- The asset form sent lowercase type names that validation rejected, so no
  asset could be created from the UI.
- OAuth password setup hashed its token with bcrypt and then looked it up by
  equality; bcrypt salts every call, so the lookup could never match and every
  attempt reported "Invalid token".
- A single-field expense edit was rejected for missing the other three fields.
- `/api/auth/delete-account` did not exist.
- Settings reported "Failed to obtain authentication token" for every account
  not signed in through Firebase.

### Removed

Self-update (it drove `git`, `npm` and `systemctl` through `child_process`),
the setup wizard, the rate limiter (its rules never matched a single request),
and every proxy route. `/api/updates/*` now answers "disabled" rather than 404.

### Known gaps

Email delivery is unimplemented, so OAuth password setup refuses in production
rather than pretending to send. Rate limiting no longer exists and wants
rebuilding on `@upstash/ratelimit`.

### Verified

223 assertions against a real Postgres - 73 for auth, 61 for the portfolio
modules, 57 for market data and the rest, and 32 for the cutover checklist run
against the deployment itself - plus browser verification of the live
application. The browser pass is what caught the last defect: the asset manager
reported "Failed to load assets" for a signed-in user, because the page sent a
stale bearer token and the server preferred it over a perfectly good cookie.
