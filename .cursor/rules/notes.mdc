# Development Notes

General guidelines and reminders for AI assistants working on this project.

## Command Execution

- Do not try and run the project via `dev` or `build` command unless I explicitly ask you to.
- Always ask before running any commands that might affect the production environment
- Prefer reading code and documentation over running commands to understand the project

## Project Context

- This is a self-hosted portfolio management system called "Profolio"
- Frontend uses Next.js 15 with React 18 and TypeScript
- Backend uses NestJS with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL
- Focus on financial data privacy and security
- Uses TanStack Query for data fetching (not SWR)
- Uses Radix UI primitives (not Shadcn/ui)

## Development Approach

- Always check existing patterns before creating new components
- Prefer server components in Next.js when possible
- Use client components only when needed for interactivity
- Follow the established project structure in frontend/ and backend/ directories
